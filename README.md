## 🌟 What is StarGate?

StarGate is an easy tool that helps you organize, control, and scale your infrastructure setup using automation. It works with Ansible, a widely used software tool for managing computer systems through code. With StarGate, you get a clear view of your infrastructure projects and can run them without writing complex commands.

This app is designed for people who want to automate how their computer systems are set up and managed but prefer a user-friendly way to do it. It brings together the power of automation into one platform that you run on your own servers or computers.

## 💻 Who Should Use StarGate?

StarGate fits best for:

- System administrators who want a simple interface to control automated tasks.
- Teams managing multiple servers and need to keep infrastructure organized.
- Anyone interested in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), but not comfortable with command-line tools.
- Users who want clear monitoring and management of their automation processes.
  
No programming skills are needed. If you can download and run apps, you can start using StarGate.
